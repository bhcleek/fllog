                 fldigi compatible logbook xml_server

This document describes the interface requirements for a logbook server
that supports a tcpip / xmlrpc interface for operating with fldigi,
flwkey, etc.

fllog is a program written in C++ and compiled for all of the fldigi
target operating systems.  It is identical to fldigi's built-in logbook
and uses the same ADIF  flat database files.  It's purpose is act as a
tcpip server that supports multiple running instances of fldigi, flwkey
or any other tcpip client with the correct xmlrpc support.  fllog can
reside on the same, another computer on a LAN, or a computer accessible
on a WAN.

Any program can act as the fldigi logbook with automatic log entry from
fldigi.  A side benefit is that a WinKeyer user with flwkey acting as
the computer interface can also use the same logbook, simultaneously
with multiple instances of fldigi.

The logbook program only needs to incorporate an xmlrpc server with a
very small set of xmlrpc commands/queries.

========================================================================
The client program tests for access to the server using

system.list_methods

The return should be similar to:

log.add_record,    s:s, adds new ADIF-RECORD
log.get_record,    s:s, returns ADIF-RECORD for CALL
log.update_record, s:s, updates current record with specified ADIF-RECORD
log.check_dup,     s:s, return true/false/possible for ADIF record
log.list_methods,  s:s, return this list

========================================================================
Request record if it exists else return "NO_RECORD"
Returns ADIF record

log.get_record		log.get_record CALL

If found the return string is an ADIF record formatted iaw the current
ADIF specification.  Empty fields may be sent with a zero size of not at
all.  see Field specifiers below.

Example of return strings as fldigi operator enters the call N3FJP into
the CALL control on fldigi's log entry:

NO_RECORD
NO_RECORD
<CALL:5>N3FJP<COUNTRY:13>United States<STATE:2>MD<FREQ:8>3.081500
<GRIDSQUARE:6>FM19tm<NAME:5>Glenn
<NOTES:39>a new record
for N3FJP
with added notes
<QSO_DATE:8>20150721<QSO_DATE_OFF:8>20150721<QTH:7>Bel Air
<TIME_OFF:6>133830<TIME_ON:6>133300

<eor> terminator is optional.

========================================================================
Add a record to the logbook database

log.add_record		log.add_record ADIF_RECORD

where ADIF_RECORD is a valid string record iaw with current ADIF spec-
ification.  Empty fields may be sent with a zero size of not at all.
see Field specifiers below.

No reply from logbook server.

example of ADIF_RECORD passed by fldigi:

<QSO_DATE:8>20150721<QSO_DATE_OFF:8>20150721
<TIME_ON:4>1333<TIME_OFF:6>133436
<CALL:5>N3FJP<FREQ:8>3.081500<MODE:0><RST_SENT:0><RST_RCVD:0><TX_PWR:0>

<IOTA:0><DXCC:0><QSL_VIA:0><QSLRDATE:0><QSLSDATE:0><eor>

The record may include linefeed (0x0A) characters between fields (but
they are not necessary).  Linefeed characters may be included with the
field and they are included in the field count.  i.e.

<NOTES:39>a new record
for N3FJP
with added notes
<IOTA ...

========================================================================
Request a check for a duplicate record
Arguments: CALLSIGN MODE TIME_SPAN FREQ

log.check_dup		log.check_dup CALLSIGN MODE TIME_SPAN FREQ

CALLSIGN - amateur callsign
MODE - ADIF mode specifier (see table below)
TIME_SPAN - time in minutes from current time back
FREQ - frequency in Hertz

returns "true" if a duplicate is found OR "false" if not found

========================================================================
XmlRpc server address/port:

   default values: 127.0.0.1 / 8421

fldigi can be configured to use a server on any valid socket address/port
pair

192.168.1.69  / 8900

dave-acer / 8910

Note that a local domain-name-server must be present to use a "named"
address rather than the quad URL address specifier.
