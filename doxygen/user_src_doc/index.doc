\section sFllogDesc Logbook Server

The logbook server maintains a large set of QSO logbook fields that will
probably be sufficient for casual operating, contesting and some certificate
logging.  All of the fields that are captured in the logbook are maintained
in an ADIF database that can be read by any logbook program that can read the
ADIF text format.  The server can open any logbook adif file, including those
created by fldigi.  You should NOT open an adif logbook file by more than one
program at a time.  The database uses "flat files" and simultaneous use by
more than a single program may corrupt the file.

The complete set of logbook fields are:
<center>

The data in the fllog logbook can be exported to external text files; ADIF,
text, and CSV (comma separated value).   The ADIF can be read by any ADIF
compatible logbook program.  The text output is suitable for use in a
wordprocessor and for printing.  The CSV can be read into many spreadsheet
programs such as Excel, Open Office or Gnumeric.

Fllog will respond to a both duplicate and last contact queries from the
client program

If you have previously worked a station the logbook will be searched for
the most recent qso and fill the Name, Qth and other fields from the
logbook.  This data is then passed back to the client program.

You open the logbook by selecting from the View menu; View/Logbook.
The logbook "File:" control will show you which logbook you currently have open.
FLlogi can maintain an unlimited (except for disk space) number of logbooks.

<center>
\image latex logbook.png "Logbook Server" width=5.5in
\image html logbook.png "Logbook Server"
</center>

You can resize the dialog to suit your screen size and operating needs.
FLlog will remember the placement and size for subsequent use.

You can create new entries, update existing entries, and delete entries
using this dialog.  You can also search for an entry by callsign.  The
browser can be sorted by Date, Callsign, Frequency or Mode.  The sort can
be forward or backward with the most recent being the default selected
entry after each sort.  You execute the sort by clicking on the column
button at the top of the column to be sorted.  Each click causes the sort
to reverse.  I like to view my log with the most recent at the top.  You
might want to view it with the most recent on the bottom.

There are no frills such as keeping track of DXCC worked, fancy printouts
etc.  FLlog's logbook is primarily a capture function.  You can export
your data for use with an external database or for uploading to LOTW or
eQSL.  Data from those sources can also be used for importing into the
logbook.

\subsection ssConfig Configure
Access the configuration dialog from the "Config" menu.

<center>
\image latex config.png "Configure" width=2.5in
\image html config.png "Configure"
</center>

The log browser can be set to view either time ON or time OFF.

The main dialog font, font size, font color, and background colors can be changed to
any that the operating system supports.  The program will try to resize the
main dialog and it's contents to the new setting.

The station entries are those recorded with each new logbook record.  Change these
as necessary when you change your operation environment.

\subsection ssEvents Event log

Two dialogs open the first time you use fllog, the logbook dialog shown above
and an event log dialog.
<center>
\image latex event_log.png "Event Log" width=5.5in
\image html event_log.png "Event log"
</center>
The event log exposes program operation, particularly the data flow between
the fllog server and any connect client programs such as fldigi.  Moving the
level slider to the right exposes more event details.  The events are also
written to a file named "debug_log.txt" in the default fllog files folder,
<br>
<center>
| OS             | location                                            |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|W2K, XP         |C:\\Documents and Settings\\<urlogin>\\fllog.files\\ |
|Vista, 7, 8, 10 |C:\\User\\<urlogin>\\fllog.files\\                   |
|Linux           |/home/<user-name>/.fllog/                            |
|OS-X            |/Users/<user-name>/.fllog/                           |
</center>
<br>

It's contents are the same as displayed in the event log dialog:
<br>
\verbatim
I: main: FLLOG 1.2.6 log started on 
Fri Apr 12 08:14:54 2019
I: readfile_:
================================================
Read Logbook: /home/dave/.fllog/logbook.adif
      read 3474 records in  0.1 seconds
================================================
\endverbatim
<br>
The program remembers the visibility of the event log.  On subsequent program
starts the event log dialog will only be displayed if that was it's state the
last time the program was run and exited.  Access to the event log dialog is
on the Help menu.

\section sLogExport Exporting Logbook Data

The user may export all or selected records consisting of all or selected
fields.  Access to this export function of available from the menu
"File/Log/Export ADIF", "File/Log/Export Text", and
"File/Log/Export CSV".

\subsection ssExportADIF Export ADIF

Selecting the Export ADIF menu item opens the following dialog:

<center>
\image latex export-setup.png "Export Setup" width=5.5in
\image html export-setup.png "Export Setup"
</center>
<br>

If you want to export every record press the "Check All" in the left panel.
You can also select and deselect individual records.  Choose which fields
you want to export with the right panel controls.  Press the OK button to
continue or Cancel to abort the operation.  A file chooser dialog will open
which allows you to specify the name and location of the exported file.  Use
the extension ".adi" on Windows and ".adif" on the other OS'.

Right click on the "Defaults" button to save the currently selected fields
as the new default.  Left click on the "Defaults" button to enable the
default fields.

Enable the "1/line" check box if you want the adif record to be written with
one field per line.  That increases the file size, but makes the file easier
to read.

The "eQSL" and "LoTW" buttons will preset the fields to the minumum required
fields for the respective exports.

\subsection ssExportTextCSV Export Text / CSV

The same Export Setup dialog is used for Text and CSV exports.

The Text export produces a simple space delimited file with columns set at
locations dictated by the field size for each field that is exported.  It is
suitable for use with a word processing program or for printing a hardcopy
of your activities.

The CSV is a "Character Separated Value" file with the TAB character used as
the field separator.  This type of file can be imported into nearly all
spreadsheet programs such as Gnumeric, Open Office or MS Excel.

\section sCabrilloReport Creating a Cabrillo Report

<center>
\image latex cabrillo-setup.png "Cabrillo Setup" width=5.5in
\image html cabrillo-setup.png "Cabrillo Setup"
</center>
<br>

If you want to export every record press the "Check All" in the left panel.

Select the Contest type from the pull down menu in the right panel.  FLlog
knows how to format the various fields for each contest.  When satisfied
with the setup press OK.  You will then have the opportunity to specify the
location and name of the cabrillo output file.

You should be careful not to duplicate the data in the Cabrillo report.

For example:

You captured outgoing exchange data in fldigi as 
\verbatim
<XBEG><RST> <CNTR><XEND>
\endverbatim
Do not enable the "RST sent" and "Serial # out" check boxes as this info is 
already contained in the "Exchange in" field.

You captured incoming exchange data into the Exch field as RST SER# TIME.
Do not enable the "RST rcvd" or the "Serial # in" check boxes.

You must then open the file with a plain text editor and modify the
appropriate entries.  Check with each contest sponsor to see what their
requirements are.

Here is an example of a generated Cabrillo report format before being edited:
